# MTCNN-v2 face detector (pycaffe version)

Author: zhaoyafei0210@gmail.com (https://github.com/walkoncross)

This repo is based on DuinoDu's MTCNN-v1 (3 stages) repo: https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn.
In this repo we add the 4th stage: LNet, so now it's the same as MTCNN-v2.

And also 3 wrappers of MTCNN-v2 are included for easy usage.
